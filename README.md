# Python-Project

## Poirier_OOP_FinalProj_2025.py:
- has a Seq class, DNA class, RNA class and Protein class
- The Seq class cleans the sequence, makes overlapping kmers of a given sequence and produces fasta formatted files; the length of kmer can be changed
- The DNA class includes functions that calculates the number of GC in a sequence, returns the reverse complement of the sequence and returns all six frames of the sequence
- The RNA class transcribes the DNA sequence, provides the codons and then translate the sequence into amino acids
- Lastly, the Protein class calculates the total hydrobicity and total molecular weight of the amino acid sequence. This file also includes doc tests that tests every function of each class. 

## PythonProject_2025.ipynb:
- a Jupyter Notebook that tests Seq class, DNA class, RNA class and Protein class from Poirier_OOP_FinalProj_2025.py.

## PoirierPythonRefresher.py:
- a Python lab exercise that includes making functions on calculating weight matrix which is the probability of each nucleotide at a position, a function that finds a motif of interest and a function that calculates Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity matrix. 

## PoirierPandasScipyPractice-1.ipynb:
- a Jupyter notebook that goes through a tutorial to understand Pandas and Scipy statistical methods.
