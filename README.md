# Python-Project

Poirier_OOP_FinalProj_2025.py has a Seq class, DNA class, RNA class and Protein class. The Seq class cleans the sequence, makes overlapping kmers of a given sequence and produces fasta formatted files; the length of kmer can be changed. The DNA class includes functions that calculates the number of GC in a sequence, returns the reverse complement of the sequence and returns all six frames of the sequence. The RNA class transcribes the DNA sequence, provides the codons and then translate the sequence into amino acids. Lastly, the Protein class calculates the total hydrobicity and total molecular weight of the amino acid sequence. 

The PythonProject_2025.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook that tests Seq class, DNA class, RNA class and Protein class from Poirier_OOP_FinalProj_2025.py.
